            Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€“ like water. Now you put
            water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle,
            it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the
            teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
